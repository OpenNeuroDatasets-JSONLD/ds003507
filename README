General description:
We measured brain activity in participants while they viewed naturalistic video clips and listened to instrumental music. We created valence congruent or incongruent audiovisual stimuli while matching arousal at a moderate level.

Twenty-one healthy, right-handed adult volunteers (14
women, mean age = 22 years, age range = 19–30 years)
participated in the experiment.

Stimuli consisted of 3-sec audiovisual clips that were
created from video and music components that were selected based on valence and arousal ratings from a previously developed and validated in-house affective stimuli
set.

The experimental design crossed visual valence (positive, negative) with auditory valence (positive, negative), producing four audiovisual conditions: two congruent, visual positive with auditory positive (VpAp) and visual negative with auditory negative (VnAn), and two incongruent, visual positive with auditory negative (VpAn) and visual negative with auditory positive (Vn Ap). In the scanner, participants were presented with 144 experimental trials and 24 catch trials distributed over three sessions. There were 12 experimental and 2 catch trials for each of the four conditions per session (12 experimental trials×4 conditions×3 sessions=144 trials; 2 catch trials× 4 conditions × 3 sessions = 24 trials). Audiovisual pairings with the same exemplars were restricted to the same session (i.e., cross-validation fold) to generalize the identification of audiovisual affective representation across
stimuli. In addition to breaks between sessions for the
participants to relax, there was also a 12-sec break in
the middle of each session.
